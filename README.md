# Is Prime

Welcome to the GitHub repository for an efficient algorithm to determine whether a given number is prime or not with 95% accuracy in constant time (O(1)). Prime numbers have always been an interesting topic in the field of mathematics and computer science, and detecting them with high accuracy and efficiency is a challenge that has been tackled by many researchers. This algorithm uses the fact that most of the numbers are not prime, to detect prime number.

## FAQ

#### Is this project serious?

Yes, this is a 100% serious project.

#### Where where does 95%+ come from?

When we take random integer between 1 and 2,147,483,647, there are around 105,000,000 prime numbers. So chance that our number will be prime is ~4,88%.

#### How does optimized implementation work?

The code runs faster when there are no ussless spaces and new lines.
